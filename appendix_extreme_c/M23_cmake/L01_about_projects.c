/**
 * We program to make and develop projects, develop new features, fix bugs and others, this isn't 
 * only applicable to C/C++, as other languages also need to be built first. And this is the first
 * thing you are going to make as you join a team.
 * 
 * You have seen short projects throught this lessons, but some codes... only are huge and get
 * longer and longer, so it becomes crucial to have a proper mechanism for building.
 * 
 * The origin to search for a solution for large compilition sesions, was in 1976 at Bell Labs,
 * that proposed one of the first 'build systems' called 'Make'. But let's check what it is.
 * 
 * BUILD SYSTEM: It is a program that commpiles codes or code bases, in C this means to produce
 * the source, executable, object files or static libraries are obtained, some of the build systems
 * also provides a 'dependency management' tool which comes very handy in big projects, this
 * process is reflected in the Makefiles that are recourse files with info to compile and link
 * codes. In this module, we will talk about Make and CMake.
 * 
 * NOTE: In the following lessons you will know some of the most used building systems (3) for 
 * projects, your decision of using one of them should be a long-commitment and make sure what do
 * you need, for example, dependency management, integration, flexibility or others, you can check:
