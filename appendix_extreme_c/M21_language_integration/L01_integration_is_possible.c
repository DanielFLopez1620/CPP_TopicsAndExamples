/**
 * Many higher-level languages were writtten in C, and they have been developed with tools and
 * compilers written in C. Remeber that a programming language objective is to generate an program
 * that works, and it is also important to be able to use the functionalities exposed by the 
 * Operating System. You have already read about the C Standard, but there are others, for example,
 * Jave SE (Java Standard Edition).
 * 
 * Let's talk briefly about Java, if you didn't know, Java is compiled by using an intermediate 
 * language called 'bytecode', and for this you will ned the JRE (Java Runtime Environment) 
 * installed, which provides a virtual machine that is able to simulate the functions exposed by
 * the C standard library.
 * 
 * We are gonna make some implementatioons of C that will be able to work in other languages.
 * Similar to the situation presented in the last module, we are gonna use the original code, and then we
 * are gonna go through a exploration by making comments.
 * 
 * WHEN READY: Go to the project folder and locate the file 'cstack.h'
