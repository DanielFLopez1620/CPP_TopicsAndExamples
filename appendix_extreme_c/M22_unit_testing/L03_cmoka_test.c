/**
 * CMOKA: Written entertyl in C, with only the standard library as a dependency, which allows to do
 * test in a pretty close environment to the actual production, and it works on many platforms, as 
 * you only needd a C compiler.
 * 
 * It is 'de facto' in testing C programs, it offers test fixtures to initialize and clear testing
 * environments before and after each test case. Also functions function mocking (well... this is
 * obvious) and it is very useful, here in this code we will implement a test with this library.
 * 
 * One of the main 'to-do' for tests with CMocka is to implement tast cases that return void and
 * receive void** arguments, as this will allow to use 'states' and receive them to get the
 * feedback. Also, you will need to implement to functions 'setup' and 'tear_down', which are test
 * fixtures called before and after the test case to do what indicates her name for each test case.
 * 
 * NOTE: If you do not have CMocka, you can install it in Ubuntu with:
 * 
 *      sudo apt-get install libcmocka-dev
 * 
 * For the execution of this code, you can run:
 * 
 *      gcc -g -c L02_fibonacci.c -o impl.o
 *      gcc -g -c L03_cmoka_test.c -o cmoka_test.o
 *      gcc impl.o cmoka_test.o -lcmocka -o exe_moka_test.out
 *      ./exe_moka_test.out
