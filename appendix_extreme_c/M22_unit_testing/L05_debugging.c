/**
 * You will always find bugs, or error in tests, then you need to find a bug... but how? Well this
 * involves a lot of sessions of debugging (word that comes when the computers were so big that
 * you will usually find literally bug like mocks in the system machinery leading to malfunctions),
 * but again, debugging isn't only about running the code slower, you will have to consider more
 * things.
 * 
 * After all, a program can be thought as a black box, and with debuggers you can check the code 
 * step by step and focus your attention in the results generated
