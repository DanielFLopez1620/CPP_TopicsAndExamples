/**
 * Testing is always an important part of developing, no matter the programming language and it is 
 * a must for a real project.
 * 
 * The first question to bring to the table is.... What are we testing? What is the test about?
 * So, we can consider a 'functional' (functionality in general, related with requirementes, modules,
 * componentes, systems that expect a certain output) or 'non-functional'(quality level with memory, 
 * complexity, time to completation and security) approaches.
 * 
 * But for this we will need to focus on certain levels, that are:
 * 
 * - UNIT TESTING:
 * - INTEGRATION TESTING:
 * - SYSTEM TESTING:
 * - ACCEPTANCE TESTING:
 * - REGRESSION TESTING:
