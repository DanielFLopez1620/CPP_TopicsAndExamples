/**
 * GOOGLE TEST: It is a testing framework oriented to C++ that can be also used in C programs.
 * As you may suppose, we will need to use the 'extern C' for making sure it will test it for a
 * C program. You can compare the canges between 'L02_fibonacci.c" and "L04_fibonacci_cpp.h" to
 * understand better the idea.
 * 
 * Now, we will focus on the Google Test implementation here, our first steps are going to be
 * the include of the needed libraries. In this case #include <gtest/gtest.h>.
 * 
 * As you will see, here we encapsultate the tests with the TEST(...) macro, there are other like
 * TEST_F and TEST_F that are specific to C++, it works by passsing the original function as the
 * first arg, and the name of the test case as the second arg. And like CMocka, you have 
 * assertions related with equality and inequality.
 * 
 * Finally, you will need to run it, remember that you will need to use gcc and g++ due to Google
 * Test being C++ oriented:
 * 
 *      gcc -g -c L02_fibonacci.c -o impl.o
 *      g++ -std=c++11 -g -c L04_google_test.cpp -o gtests.o
 *      g++ impl.o gtests.o -lgtest -lpthread -o gtest.out
 *      ./gtest.out
 * 
 * NOTE: Try to modify the cases to get the errors, and check how the assertions are show. Also,
 * you may have interest in using the Google Mock library, so check for more info on the internet.
