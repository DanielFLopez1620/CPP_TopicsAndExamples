/**
 * In the case of unit testing, you will need to isolate the function for test them, we will
 * illustrate the situation with the code from the 'L02_fibonacci.h' and 'L02_fibonacci.c' to make
 * the corresponding test, here in the main, you will find info of the execution of them
 * and also how the tests works.
 * 
 * First, for executing this code, you can use:
 *      gcc -c L02_fibonacci.c -o impl.o
 *      gcc -c L02_main_fib.c -o main.o
 *      gcc impl.o main.o -o fib.out
 * 
 * As our fibonacci code has two function, we will need two independent test files, we have
 * implemented them in the files: "L02_test_fib.c" and "L02_test_next_num.c" each one implements
 * a set of functions that begins with "TESTCASE" which is used as a convention to indicate a test,
 * followed by the name of the original function and last a indication of the situation to test.
 * In the case of next_num we only have a test case, but in the case of fib we have a test suite
 * (in other words, a collecction of test cases).
 * 
 * But for making our tests work, we will need another main, that will load and call the test calls,
 * so if something goes wrong we can know it. And the file is 'L02_tests.c". You can run the test with:
 * 
 *      gcc -g -c L02_fibonacci.c -o impl.o
 *      gcc -g -c L02_test_nex_num.c -o test1.o
 *      gcc -g -c L02_test_fib.c -o test2.o
 *      gcc -g -c L02_tests.c -o main.o
 *      gcc impl.o test1.o test2.o main.o testing.out
 *      ./testing.out
 * 
 * Everything should be right, but you can experiment with th efib function, for example, by adding
 * one to the result, and the test are gointg to fail... but.... you may not sure where or what
 * the test is failing. For that cases C/C++ provides libraries for making the tests better, in the 
 * next lesson we will talk about them.
 * 
 * Now, we need to introduce a concept "text doubles" that are objects that try to mimic a unit 
 * dependency. And after this, there is also 'mock' functions are considered to be part
 * of OOP Languages that allows manipulation, and there are also 'fake' functions that are used
 * to give a simplified functionality of a more complex function.
 * 
 * Finally, let's talk about 'code coverage' that implies that you should do tests suites
 * for all the possible cases to prevent errors and bugs later in other phases of the project. And
 * the coverage test aims to test all the code available and prevent unwanted modifications.
 *
