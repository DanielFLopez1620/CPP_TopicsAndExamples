 * UNIX DOMAIN SOCKETS: They are sockets that can operate within the same machine, and they can be
 * biderectional (so one can read/write over the same channel), and they are more flexible because
 * they are 'session-aware' and 'message-aware'.
 *

 * and one is related with how computers networks works.
