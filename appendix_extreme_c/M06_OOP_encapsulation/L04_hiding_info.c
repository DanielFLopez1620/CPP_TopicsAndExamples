 * In OOP you need to protect your data or secure it, so it isn't visible to other parts of the code. So,
 * there is only a 'public API' that allows to use the class without any consequeances in the
 * implementation of the class/structure. For achieving this in C, you will need to determine
 * what is public and what is private. Also, you will need to take advantage for the manually 
 * allocation and naming convention ( '__' as a prefix of private structures).
