/**
 * In the previous lesson we checked the standard container implementation
 * of begin() and end() member functions. However, there are more, like
 * cbegin()/cend(), rbegin()/rend(), crbegin()/crend() that return iterators. 
 * And after C++17 more appeared, like std::data() that returns a pointer to
 * the memory block, std::size() that returns the size of the container, 
 * std::empty() that specifies wheter the container is empty or not. Also,
 * in C++20 std::ssize() was added to return the size of a container as a 
 * signed int.
