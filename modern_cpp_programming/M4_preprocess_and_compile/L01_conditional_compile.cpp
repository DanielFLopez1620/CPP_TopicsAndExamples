/**
 * Compilation is the process where your code is transformed in instructions
 * that the computer can understand, the compiler works over a file sent by the
 * preprocessor.
 * 
 * The first lesson for this process is oriented to conditional compilation,
 * which allows to mantain a single code base but produce different results
 * according the conditions set and the OS. This can be achieved with the 
 * directives: #if, #ifdef, #ifndef, #elif, #else and #endif, which allow to
 * set conditions that will be considered by the preprocessor.
